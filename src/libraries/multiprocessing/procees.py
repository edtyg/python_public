# Pool method allows users to define the number of workers and distribute all processes to available processors in a First-In-First-Out schedule, 
# handling process scheduling automatically. 
# Pool method is used to break a function into multiple small parts using map or starmap(line 19) â€” running the same function with different input arguments. 
# Whereas Process method is used to run different functions.
