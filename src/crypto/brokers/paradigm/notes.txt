# Overview
Paradigm has three major products, Multi-Dealer RFQ (DRFQ), Global RFQ (GRFQ), and the Future Spread Dashboard (FSPD).
These three products are separate and require separate authenticated interaction via their specific version & product connections URLs.
Paradigm uses RESToverHTTP and JSON-RPCoverWebSockets as our API interfaces to be consistent with the broader crypto space.
Feel free to reach out for any technical support as we would love to help!


# Futures Spread - Our main focus now
FSPD - Brief Overview
The Future Spread Dashboard (FSPD) is to be used to trade Future Spreads using a central limit Order Book. 
This product allows you to trade spreads as a single Strategy, priced at the Strategy level without any leg risk.
Anyone is able to participate in the Order Book of a Strategy as either a Taker or a Maker. 
All Orders, Trades and interactions are on an anonymous basis.
FTX, Deribit, and Bybit are available as venues.

# rate limits
RESToverHTTP requests are rate limited per desk and by group. 
By default, the read-only GET requests are rate limited to 100 requests per second 
and all other requests, such as POST, PATCH, and DELETE are limited to 10 requests per second. 
Paradigm can customize these limits by desk depending on the desk's volume of operations. 
The desk administrator may request a limit increase by contacting support.
You cannot horizontally scale your rate limit per desk by using multiple API Keys.


# market maker protection
Paradigm's Market Maker Protection (MMP) program is designed to protect Makers 
and limits the number of executions possible across a desk across a period of time.

All of a Maker's Desk's existing Quotes will be canceled and the 
Maker's Desk will be prevented from creating additional Quotes if two executions occur within one second. 
To remove this protection, the user can send a successful RESToverHTTP [PATCH] /v1/{product}/mmp/status/ request. 
The MMP protection is automatically removed within 10 seconds of triggering by Paradigm without any interaction necessary by the user.

Takers are only able to execute twice every five seconds.
This feature is enabled for all Paradigm clients and cannot be disabled. 
The conditions of MMP being triggered cannot be configured by the user.

MMP is across all of your Desk's Paradigm API Keys. 
MMP protections and workflows are shared across DRFQ+GRFQ products.

This means, upon MMP being triggered by either DRFQ or GRFQ, 
the Maker's Desk will be unable to create any additional quotes 
and all existing quotes will be canceled irrespective of 
whether you are using DRFQ or GRFQ until a 
[PATCH] /v1/drfq/mmp/status/ or 
[PATCH] /v1/grfq/mmp/status/ request is successful. 
Desk interactions with FSPD will remain unaffected.

MMP functionality is not applied for FSPD.
