backtesting methodology - method A

1) Pull BRRAP - 3pm to 4pm HKT
2) Pull Binance and okx trade records - 3pm to 4pm HKT

inputs: k partitions, weights (0.6 binance, 0.4 okx)

3) Get binance/okx price
for binance e.g.
sort all the trade records by time
take all trade records in the hour and partition then into k partitions (e.g 10)
in each partition take the price of the median trade done
i.e 1000 trades done in partition 1 - extract price of trade number 500

do this for the remaining partitions and take the average price (sum the price and divide by k)
the average px would be binance's price

4) repeat for okx
repeat the same for okx
and get okx's price

5) do a weightage and get the weighted price

6) compare weighted price vs BRRAP
